  <h1>Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy Workshop Series</h1>
</div>


<div class="content box"> <h2>Workshop Series</h2>

<p><a>Differential privacy</a> is a promising approach to the
privacy-preserving release of data: it offers a strong guaranteed
bound on the increase in harm that a user incurs as a result of
participating in a differentially private data analysis. Several
mechanisms and software tools have been developed to ensure
differential privacy for a wide range of data analysis tasks, such as
combinatorial optimization, machine learning, answering distributed
queries, etc.</p>

<p> Researchers in differential privacy come from several area of
computer science as algorithms, programming languages, security,
databases, machine learning, as well as from several areas of
statistics and data analysis. The workshop is intended to be an
occasion for researchers from these different research areas to
discuss the recent developments in the theory and practice of
differential privacy.</p>
