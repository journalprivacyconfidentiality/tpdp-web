<p>
Differential privacy (DP) is the leading framework for data analysis with rigorous privacy guarantees. In the last 18 years, it has transitioned from the realm of pure theory to large scale, real world deployments.
</p>
<p>
Differential privacy is an inherently interdisciplinary field, drawing researchers from a variety of academic communities including machine learning, statistics, security, theoretical computer science, databases, and law. The combined effort across a broad spectrum of computer science is essential for differential privacy to realize its full potential.  To this end, this workshop aims to stimulate discussion among participants about both the state-of-the-art in differential privacy and the future challenges that must be addressed to make differential privacy more practical.
</p>

<p>
Specific topics of interest for the workshop include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Theory of DP</li>
<li>DP and security</li>
<li>Privacy preserving machine learning</li>
<li>DP and statistics</li>
<li>DP and data analysis</li>
<li>Trade-offs between privacy protection and analytic utility</li>
<li>DP and surveys</li>
<li>Programming languages for DP</li>
<li>Relaxations of DP</li>
<li>Relation to other privacy notions and methods</li>
<li>Experimental studies using DP</li>
<li>DP implementations</li>
<li>DP and policy making</li>
<li>Applications of DP</li>
<li>Reconstruction attacks and memorization</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Submissions:</b> Authors are invited to submit a short abstract of new work or work published since June 2024 (the most recent TPDP submission deadline). Submissions must be 4 pages maximum, not including references. Submissions may also include appendices, but these are only read at reviewer's discretion. There is no prescribed style file, but authors should ensure a minimum of 1-inch margins and 10pt font. Submissions are not anonymized, and should include author names and affiliations.
</p>

<p>
Submissions will undergo a lightweight review process and will be judged on originality, relevance, interest, and clarity. Based on the volume of submissions to TPDP 2024 and the workshop's capacity constraints, we expect that the review process will be somewhat more competitive than in years past. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop either as a talk or a poster.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will not have formal proceedings and is not intended to preclude later publication at another venue. In-person attendance is encouraged, though authors of accepted abstracts who cannot attend in person will be invited to submit a short video to be linked on the TPDP website.
</p>

<p>
Selected papers from the workshop will be invited to submit a full version of their work for publication in a <a href="https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/tpdp">special issue</a> of the <a href="https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc">Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality</a>.
